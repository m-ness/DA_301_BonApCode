# Bon Appetit Purchasing Data Analysis

 ### Description 
 The "Bon Appetit Final" folder consists of 4 different files. The 4 files are:
 
 * February 2017 data for analytics class.csv : the original file given by Piper Fernmway, Director of Bon Appetit at Denison University, which consists of the purchasing history of Bon Appetitfor the month of February 2017. File does not have the prices of the of the products purchased. 
 
 * September 2017 data for analytics class.csv : the original file given by Piper Fernmway, Director of Bon Appetit at Denison University, which consists of the purchasing history of Bon Appetitfor the month of September 2017. File does not have the prices of the of the products purchased. 
 
 * Bon_Ap_analysis.rmd : the R-Markdown file that consists of all the analysis done to obtain the total amount of each meat (Beef, Pork, Turkey, Chicken) purchased during the months of February and September of 2017. The the purchasing data from these two months was then averaged together to create a usable number of pounds for a normal month, February is a very low and September is very high. Then it multiplies the averaged month by 8 for the number of months students are at Denison and Bon Appetit is purchasing the largest amounts. It then produces the csv file Final_Average_BonAp.csv.
 
 * Final_Average_BonAp.csv : The final csv that contains the manipulated dataset from R. It contains the type of meat (Pork, Beef, Turkey, Chicken), the average amount of said mean purchased in a month, and the Estimated total amount of said meat purchased in a year.
